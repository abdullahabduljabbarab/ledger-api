# Production Log

## Day 1

### Goal
Scaffold FastAPI service, data model, PostgreSQL, health endpoint, test suite, engineering docs.

### Completed
- Created Account, Transaction, LedgerEntry SQLAlchemy models (Numeric(12,2), UUID PKs)
- Pydantic schemas with Decimal validation, gt=0 amount constraint
- Service layer with External Clearing counterparty, SELECT FOR UPDATE locking, deterministic UUID lock ordering, idempotency with SHA-256 request hash conflict detection
- All API endpoints: POST/GET accounts, POST/GET transactions, GET balance, GET entries, GET health
- Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL 16
- Alembic initial migration seeding External Clearing system account
- 22 tests passing: accounts, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, concurrency (parallel withdrawals), idempotency + 409 conflict, decimal precision (100x 0.01 = 1.00), per-transaction + global ledger invariants, entry immutability
- Engineering docs: MVP scope, requirements (14 functional + 8 non-functional), design, V&V plan with requirement-to-test traceability, security boundaries, 7 ADRs
- ruff lint passing

### Problems / Decisions
- Rejected SQLite for local dev because row-level locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) is PostgreSQL-specific and the concurrency tests need it
- Added External Clearing system account so deposits/withdrawals produce balanced entries and the global SUM=0 invariant genuinely holds
- Idempotency hash includes all business-relevant fields (type, amount, account IDs, reference) to catch mismatched retries

### Evidence
- /health returns 200 at localhost:8000
- Swagger docs live at localhost:8000/docs
- 22/22 tests green (pytest, 1.77s)
- ruff: all checks passed

### Next
Azure deployment. Provision App Service + PostgreSQL Flexible Server, deploy manually, verify live endpoint.
